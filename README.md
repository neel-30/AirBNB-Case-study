# New York Airbnb EDA and Statistical Analysis

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis of a dataset containing information about Airbnb listings in New York City. The goal is to uncover insights about the listings, their pricing, and other factors that may influence the rental market in NYC.

## Introduction

Airbnb has transformed the way people travel and find accommodation. This analysis aims to provide insights into the New York Airbnb market by examining various factors such as pricing, location, and property types. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various attributes of Airbnb listings, including:

- Listing ID
- Host ID
- Neighborhood group
- Price
- Number of reviews
- Availability
- room type etc


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, I performed the following tasks:

- Analyzed the distribution of prices across different neighborhoods.
- Examined the relationship between the number of reviews and pricing.
- Investigated the impact of property type on rental prices.
- Identified trends and patterns in the data.

## Statistical Analysis

To further understand the relationships within the data, I conducted several statistical tests, including:

- **T-Test**: To compare the means of two groups (e.g., price differences between two neighborhoods).
- **Chi-Squared Test**: To examine the relationship between categorical variables (e.g., property type and neighborhood).
- **ANOVA**: To analyze the differences among group means in a sample (e.g., comparing prices across multiple neighborhoods).

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was performed to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis. This included:

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Converting data types as necessary.
- Normalizing data for consistency.

## Visualizations

Visualizations were created to effectively communicate the findings. Key visualizations include:

- Histograms of price distributions.
- Box plots comparing prices across neighborhoods.
- Scatter plots showing relationships between variables.
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations.

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into the New York Airbnb market, highlighting key factors that influence pricing and availability. The findings can be useful for potential hosts, guests, and policymakers interested in the short-term rental market.
